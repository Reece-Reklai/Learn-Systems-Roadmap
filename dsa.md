🧠 Simplify It Mentally

🔍 Need to find things → Hash map

🔢 Need order → Tree

⏩ Need sequence → Queue

↩️ Need undo or nesting → Stack

🕒 Need priority or timing → Heap

🧱 Need hierarchy → Tree/Trie

🔗 Need relationships → Graph

💾 Need cache → Map + List

🧮 Need expressions or code representation → AST
